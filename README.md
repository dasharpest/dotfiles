## ðŸŒ¿ Information
A custom install-script for multiple themes for BSPWM & Polybar, with a theme selector to change on the fly.

The themes, configs and scripts included are original work by **[z0mbi3](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles)** and have been modified for my system, along with a ton of extra [wallpapers](https://github.com/dasharpest/dotfiles-walls) included for each theme.  The authors of additional scripts and configs used are credited below.

The script will additionally install mulitiple apps & software and also enable services for **Intel** based systems (Read the installer script for more info.)
